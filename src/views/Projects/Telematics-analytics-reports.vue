		This page was designed for users
		to have seperate (and at some point restricted) folders
		to save re-runnable reports in. For example; Jennifer may
		run a weekly report on 12 vehicles in her fleet with the
		specified filters. You can have multiple reports open
		from multiple groups, duplicate and edit reports, edit folders,
		export with even specific filters, schedule an email to be
		sent out containing the data of your specified report -
		pretty much anything.
